genetic ideas:

Slimes that prefer to be alone (avoid other slimes) produce asexually they do not rebirth but perma die. However this should not not mean they are incapable of making new slimes, if another slime of the same species comes close enough they can create more slimes. This is useful for maintaining genetic diversity in a population of solitary slimes.

then the slimes that are cooperative or friendly or don't avoid others will attempt to make new slimes with any other slime they come across regardless of species. This can lead to hybrid offspring that combine traits from both parents. 


then the aggressive or territorial slimes will "fight" on encounter, winner may gain some genetic material from the loser to pass on to its offspring. This can help spread advantageous traits through a population of aggressive slimes. When they die they form spores (this looks like the slime combining into a mass or ball) that then later "pops" spreads out and rebirth into new slimes maybe make it a random amount of slimes with a different amount of agents in each slime?
