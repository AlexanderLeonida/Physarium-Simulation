slime 7 causes crashes (shift 7 - index 0)
increasing slime causes crashes
when switching from single slime mode to unique slime mode it just changes the color of the single slime to red instead of actually starting the new mode accurately. When adding a new slime like shift 2 it works.
shift F shouldnt disable/hide overlay texture

benchmark mode:
control slime has inaccurate slime mold maze behavior
DFS explorer agents stop moving in spots 
dijkstra explorer behavior is highly inaccurate
